## Okra Tutorial


### Preface
This tutorial assumes two things:
1. You've followed the installation instructions or have a playground instance up and running
   <br><i>If this is not applicable to you:</i> Follow (the installation instructions)[https://github.com/cdkini/Okra#installation] or visit (the playground)[https://repl.it]
2. You have a decent understanding of programming fundamentals (variables, conditionals, loops, structs, etc)
   <br><i>If this is not applicable to you:</i> Learn an established language first! Okra is an academic exercise and thus should not be your first foray into programming.
